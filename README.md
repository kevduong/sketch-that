----------
**Technologies**

 - JavaScript for handling the game's logic and controlling the database, chatroom and sketching canvas
 - jQuery for manipulating the DOM
 - HTML5's Canvas to create the sketching board and rendering the drawing pixels
 - Socket.IO as a connection hub between all the features (mainly used with canvas and the chatroom)
 - Firebase was used for user authentication and logging the chatroom
 - NodeJS to support the backend
 - HTML/CSS
 
----------
## Getting started
```
npm install

node server.js
```
----------
For our Web Development course, my team, Alex Nam Kim, Kenichi Sugai, and I collaboratively built a multiplayer game that is similar to pictionary and Draw-Something. We were inspired by these games and wanted to construct something that utilizes real-time databases and HTML5 Canvas. 

It is a work in-progress and we hope to polish our existing feature.
